# iOS17BC
When iOS 17 was released the tests for `UIRefreshControl` are breaking, but the same tests are working below iOS 16

New view controller life cycle method has been introduced [viewIsAppearing](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiviewcontroller/4195485-viewisappearing). It is backward compatible to iOS 13+

This method gets call after `viewWillAppear` and before `viewDidAppear` so it is called in-betweeen.

From iOS 13 to iOS 17 we need to move refreshControl?.beginRefreshing() call to `viewIsAppearing` so that it can start loading/animating

In test we could have used `Window` and `RunLoop`, however making the window as `key` window is globally affecting the host application. What if we're running tests without a Host Application, such as in a framework? It wouldn't work since you cannot make the window `key` without a Host Application!

So using `FakeUIRefreshControl` we could test the state of `UIRefreshControl` which supports iOS 13 to iOS 17
